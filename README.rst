Starcross Gallery
=================

Starcross Gallery is a streamlined photo gallery Django app. Key features are:

* Justified image grid display, as used on sites like Flickr
* Easy drag and drop upload
* Straightforward object model - All metadata is pulled from the file including title and exif data


Quick start
-----------

1. Add "starcross-gallery" to your INSTALLED_APPS setting like this::

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        ...
        'starcross-gallery',
    ]

2. Include the gallery URLconf in your project urls.py like this::

    path('gallery/', include('starcross-gallery.urls')),

3. Run `python manage.py migrate` to create the models.

4. Start the development server and create any albums you required in http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/. It's not necessary to create albums if you prefer just a single image feed

5. Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/gallery/ to access your image feed. Drag your images onto the page and you will see a flashing highlighted box .
