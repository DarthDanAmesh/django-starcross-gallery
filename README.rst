Quick start
-----------

1. Add "gallery" to your INSTALLED_APPS setting like this::

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        ...
        'gallery',
    ]

2. Include the gallery URLconf in your project urls.py like this with your preferred location e.g. "gallery/"::

    path('gallery/', include('gallery.urls')),

3. Run `python manage.py migrate gallery` to create the models.

4. Start the development server and create any albums you required in http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/. It's not necessary to create albums if you prefer just a single image feed

5. Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/gallery/ to access your image feed. Drag your images onto the page and you will see a flashing highlighted box.
